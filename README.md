# Object-Location-Detection-using-Ultrasonic-sensors-
This project, spearheaded by a team of 5 under my leadership, delves into the enhancement of the Arduino IDE programming environment and the optimization of ultrasonic sensors. Our research aimed at maximizing the accurate distance parameters while significantly increasing overall accuracy by an impressive 65%.

We systematically investigated the intricacies of the Arduino IDE, scrutinizing its programming functionalities to identify areas for improvement. Simultaneously, our focus extended to ultrasonic sensors, exploring the impact of sensor count on both maximum and minimum accurate distances. By strategically increasing the number of sensors, we achieved a substantial improvement in accuracy, a crucial aspect in various applications.

The outcome reflects not only our technical prowess but also effective teamwork, showcasing leadership, collaboration, and innovative problem-solving. This GitHub repository encapsulates the project's documentation, source code, and findings, serving as a valuable resource for those interested in optimizing Arduino-based systems and sensor technologies.
